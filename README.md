# go_enrichment
Visualize enriched GO terms from a differential expression analysis comparing human and mouse tissues from an [ENCODE data set](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/48/17224).

For this comparison, I used the FPKM provided by the authors and an alternative normalization (Probes) taking into account the differences between the human and mouse gene annotations.
